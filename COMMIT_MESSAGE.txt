chore: remove redundant documentation files

Simplify project documentation by keeping only essential files:
- Keep: README.md (user-facing documentation)
- Keep: AGENTS.md (AI agent guidelines for development)

Removed redundant/outdated files:
- CHANGELOG.md (version history tracked in git commits/releases)
- CONTRIBUTING.md (development info now in AGENTS.md)
- DAEMON_MODE.md (details now in README.md)
- DAEMON_STATUS.md (temporary status file)
- FINAL_STATUS.md (temporary status file)
- QUICK_START.md (quick start now in README.md)
- .github/CICD_QUICKSTART.md (CI/CD info in AGENTS.md)
- .github/SCOOP_SETUP.md (Scoop setup in workflow comments)
- .github/workflows/README.md (workflow docs in AGENTS.md)

Benefits:
- Single source of truth for users (README.md)
- Single source of truth for developers/agents (AGENTS.md)
- Reduced maintenance overhead
- Clearer project structure
- Release notes auto-generated by GitHub workflows
